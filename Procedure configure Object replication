To configure object replication in Azure, you can use the Azure portal or the Azure PowerShell cmdlets. Here are the steps to configure object replication in Azure:

Navigate to the storage account that you want to configure object replication for in the Azure portal.

In the left menu, click on "Replication" under "Settings".

Click on the "Add Replication" button to create a new replication policy.

Select the replication type (e.g. LRS, GRS, RA-GRS) and the target region for the replication.

Click on the "Create" button to create the replication policy.

To configure object replication using PowerShell, you can use the Azure Resource Manager cmdlets to create a storage account create parameters object and set the replication properties, such as the account type and the target region. Then, use the Set-AzureRmStorageAccount cmdlet to apply the replication policy to the storage account.
